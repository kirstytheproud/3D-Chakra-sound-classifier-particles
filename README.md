<p>
Made with p5.js JavaScript Library, and object oriented programming to create a sound reactive particle generator.
Inspired by the chakras, the particles change colour depending on the chant the program detects and interprets. </p>

A machine learning model was trained with the sounds of all seven chants (i.e. 'OM', 'VAM') using Google's Teachable Machine. Creating the app was an iterative process over 2 months, moving from a 2D space and eventually making the particles 3D using WebGL.
It works best in Firefox, and currently has issues working with Google Chrome. The particles should move and react depending on the volume of the mic input.
